# CASA003 Group Mini Project

This repo contains raw source code and static web files that deployed on the github.

**Group Members**: **Juanes Lamilla**, **Yuhao Chen**, **Zihan iu**

This project is based on the templet: (Vue Material Kit)[https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/vue/overview/material-kit/] under the vue-vite environment (VueJS 3 + Bootstrap 5).

## Components

The index page is created by some pre-built components: Navigation bar, Image + titler contained header, mosaic transparent card container and span box container.

## Design Idea

The idea of first global map came from ONS (UK trade page)[https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/latest]. It is a fantastic view that shows the trade partner
by connecting them together.

```

The web page begins with an introduction to the background of UK trade, outlining the reasons for selecting this topic and providing a detailed description of each section. The document is divided into three main parts: Global Trade Data, Regional Analysis of UK Trade, and Economic Data of London.

The (Datamap)[https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps] tool, discovered by Juanes, has proven invaluable. To enhance the appeal of the first section, we aim to present the extensive data in a more dramatic fashion. This is achieved by creating an overlapped view, where an Echart is superimposed over a graphical representation of the Earth. This visualization not only depicts the trade routes between the UK and its partners but also illustrates the fluctuations in trade values over a twenty-year period, providing a clear perspective on trends in growth or decline. For additional insights into the most common modes of cargo transportation and the predominant import/export products, users can access extended data by clicking on "reveal more trade data."
