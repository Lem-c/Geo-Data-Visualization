Strong economic health ensures funding for public services such as health care, education, and transportation, which are essential components of urban life. In addition, economic strategy affects likelihood of private investment in urban areas, determining employment opportunities and influencing business patterns, all while affecting everything from housing and business development to cultural and recreational facilities. Understanding and planning for economic fluctuations is therefore essential for effectively managing sustainable urban growth.",

A city's ability to understand and adapt to economic changes and withstand economic shocks can help determine its long-term success and sustainability.",
